For best performance, the Rust benchmark is compiled with --opt-level=3, DMD with -release -O -noboundscheck, GHC with -funbox-strict-fields and the rest with -O3. D and go take the random seed as a command line paramater in the form "-v=int", the rest take it just as plain "int". Be warned, some will segfault without it.
